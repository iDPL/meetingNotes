Items  for the meeting.
--  Visa issues in China. May call off the meeting because of this. 
--  Hailong will be in Wisconsin, already has a visa. Phil will also be in Wisconsin

Ideas for the meeting
  1. Parameters of an experiment (what to record)
  2. Define how we are running experiments (actual software based on protoypes)
  3. Scheduling of experiments (part of the Beihang/CNIC proposal)
  
Practical issues -- PerfSONAR now uses the esmond data archive system, we should look at it?
Already using APIs from perfSONAR at Beihang. (hacking the code).
