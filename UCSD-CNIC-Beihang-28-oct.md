Items  for the meeting.
--  Visa issues in China. May call off the meeting because of this. 
--  Hailong will be in Wisconsin, already has a visa. Phil will also be in Wisconsin

Ideas for the meeting
  1. Parameters of an experiment (what to record)
  2. Define how we are running experiments (actual software based on protoypes)
  3. Scheduling of experiments (part of the Beihang/CNIC proposal)
  
Practical issues -- PerfSONAR now uses the esmond data archive system, we should look at it?
Already using APIs from perfSONAR at Beihang. (hacking the code because of lack of documentation). 

Student at Beihang to look at esmond. (http://software.es.net/esmond/)

Condor-Specific Issues:
  1.  how we set the security so that we can submit jobs from any node in iDPL.
  2.  How to track failures.
  3.  How to set up the number slots to be reflective of the real machines.
  4.  Crondor seems to be working, how should we expand the capabilities
  5.
